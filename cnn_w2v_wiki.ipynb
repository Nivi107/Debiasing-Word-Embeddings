    "# Emotion Classification in texts using LSTM and Word2Vec\n",

    "### Architecture: \n",
    "(X) Text -> Embedding (W2V pretrained on wikipedia articles) -> Deep Network (CNN 1D) -> Fully connected (Dense) -> Output Layer (Softmax) -> Emotion class (Y)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Embedding Layer\n",
    "* Word Embedding is a representation of text where words that have the similar meaning have a similar representation. We will use 300 dimentional word vectors pre-trained on wikipedia articles. We can also train the w2v model with our data, however our dataset is quite small and trained word vectors might not be as good as using pretrained w2v.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Network\n",
    "* Though text data is one-dimensional, we can use 1D convolutional neural networks to extract features from our data. The result of each convolution will fire when a special pattern is detected. By varying the size of the kernels and concatenating their outputs, you’re allowing yourself to detect patterns of multiples sizes (2, 3, or 5 adjacent words). Patterns could be expressions like “I hate”, “very good” and therefore CNNs can identify them in the sentence regardless of their position. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fully Connected Layer\n",
    "* The fully connected layer takes the deep representation from the RNN/LSTM/GRU and transforms it into the final output classes or class scores. This component is comprised of fully connected layers along with batch normalization and optionally dropout layers for regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Layer\n",
    "* Based on the problem at hand, this layer can have either Sigmoid for binary classification or Softmax for both binary and multi classification output."
